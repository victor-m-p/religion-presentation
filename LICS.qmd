## Communication goal
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Different lens for studying (exploring) complex systems of interacting elements or features (that are binary). 
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- The kinds of questions that we can ask with this approach that we cannot approach with standard regression-style analyses. 
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- We usually think at the "parameter" level, but we can also think productively at the level of system states. 
:::

::: {.notes}
- in particular the work infers the (inverse) Ising model (statistical physics model). 
- not so much specific results and e.g., causal tests
- perhaps also a bit messy, but this is what I'll try to communicate
:::

## Why does culture look this way?
![](LICS/intro-2.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- social-science approach
- distinction between outcome we want to "explain"
- and predictors that explain 
- often with the idea of causation
:::

## Why does culture look this way?
![](LICS/intro-3.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- rise of socially complex societies
:::

## Why does culture look this way?
![](LICS/intro-4.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- one driver could be emergence of moralizing big Gods. 
- Norenzayan 2013
- prosociality 
- cooperation dilemma
- by monitoring and punishing transgressions. 
:::

## Why does culture look this way?
![](LICS/intro-5.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- other potential drivers that have been posited. 
- also cognitive underpinnings
- intergroup conflict
- etc. 
:::

## Why does culture look this way?
![](LICS/intro-6.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- fit some kind of regression (e.g. logistic)
- can be smart to get at causality. 
- experiments
- regressing on time (observational)
:::

## Dangers 1: non-linear causation
![](LICS/intro-7.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- Both directions have been stipulated. 
- Big debate in the literature. 
:::

## Dangers 2: context-dependence
![](LICS/intro-7.svg){ width="85%" }

::: {.notes}
- Large-scale societies support moralizing big Gods.
- Some develop trusted secular institutions. 
- This might undermine moralizing big Gods by overtaking social function.
- Also, which predictors do we want to control for. 
:::

## The Landscape View 
Societies are subject to multiple *intersecting forces and constraints* that *put demands on their features*. Some configurations better balance these constraints.  

## The Landscape View {.smaller}
Societies are subject to multiple *intersecting forces and constraints* that *put demands on their features*. Some configurations better balance these constraints.  
![](LICS/intro-8.svg){ width="80%" }

::: {.notes}
- conceptualize as one connected system of forces (holistic)
- no "predictors" and "outcomes", everything constrains everything. 
- for now we take a step back from attacking specific causal questions.
- technically, what we are doing is mathematically the same as fitting a series of logistics and converting parameters (think of parameters as coefficients). 
::: 

## The Landscape View {.smaller}
::: {.column width="45%"} 
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Parameters (*pairwise couplings* and *local fields*) imply a probability distriubtion over *configurations*
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Configurations *higher* in the landscape better balance constraints. 
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
*Equilibrium points*: Locally (meta)stable solutions to the landscape, and paths of transition between these.

:::

::: {.notes}
- (1) In our case a religion is defined by a series of yes-no answers to questions (i.e. mind-body distinction, child sacrifice). 
- (1) A configuration is a particular set of yes-no answers to questions in our case (what we call the landscape). 
- (2) Landscape we do not get directly from parameters of, say, a logistic regression. 
- (3) Equilibrium points: interesting if we have system where we want to either keep in certain equilibrium, or push out of.

## Three Questions
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- $\mathcal{Q}_1$: What are the most probable and the most improbable religious-cultural configurations? How are they organized in the topology of the religion "fitness landscape"?
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- $\mathcal{Q}_2$: What does the landscape imply about dynamics and cultural evolution?
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Can we predict features of (long lost) religious cultures that are unknown to the field?
:::

::: {.notes}
- That we cannot answer directly with parameters (e.g. from logistic)
- Landscape topology and organization.
- Dynamics and evolution. 
- Less prosaic, but important.  
::: 

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
- What are the most probable and the most improbable religious-cultural configurations? How are they organized in the topology of the religion "fitness landscape"?

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_4.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- 150 most probable: ignoring much of landscape. 
- 40% probability mass. 
- size of configurations by probability. 
- Connected if direct neighbors (1 hamming).
- hierarchical (agglomerative) clustering. 
- most correspond to observed religions (some more than one) some unobserved. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_3.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- I want to be careful but...
- Some structure
  - Yellow: pre-Axial (Bellah terminology) / indigenous. 
  - Red: axial / highest-probability.
  - Blue: spiritual and protestant "flood plain".
- Temporal exploration (but landscape not temporal).
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion

::: {.notes}
- archaic sacrificial grave traditions
- ritualistic
- difficult because negative... 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_2.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- A scholar might be interested in a specific tradition. 
- local probability region
- local peak (at our resolution / our Q)
- Would have to move through valley to get to Jehovah. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_1.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- Roman Imperial Cult (valley); 
- Should tend to flow "upwards" in the landscape. 
- Not predicted to be very stable by our landscape. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](cognitive-attractors/monitor-punish.png){ width=100% }

::: {.notes}
- Landscape encodes more "fundamental" and "context specific" constraints
- More cognitively coherent. 
- Model of human agency (care enough to punish). 
- Punishment without monitoring? 
  - karmic religions, call God up. 
- Monitoring without punishment?
  - watch, but are lazy (otiose)
- some things are just weird.
- fundamentally; Gods built on model of human agency (some cognitive dissonance, but this can exist).

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
What does the landscape imply about dynamics and cultural evolution, and can we capture fundamental and context-specific constraints on religious cultures?

- Local and global stability. 
- X axis: log of global probability. 
- Y axis: probability of remaining at current configuration for 1 time-step of a particular kind of evolutionary dynamics (Glauber: idea is to sample a neighbor and based on probability of current and new configuration we might stay of evolve). Y-axis is mean for all 20 neighbors. 
- Gives an idea about stability on different timescales. 
- Long enough timescales; baseline probability. 
- Shorter timescales; local probability region (neighbors). 
- Metastability. 
- this gives a useful vocabulary to consider dynamics.

- We can start at a particular religious tradition and consider where it might flow (or where it could have flowed). 
- Here (for clarity) impose only flow upwards in probability, terminate at local max. 
- Multiple local maxima (terminate at one of three; pretty different). 
- "supernatural punishment" & "special corpse treatment"
- two indirect paths; "official political support" lost + regained (not Northern). 
- attributes not adaptive in general; contextually. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](cognitive-attractors/attractors-table.png)

- All local maxima
- Starting from all observed configurations that are not already a local max. 
- Basin of attraction
- Cultural attractors
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](LICS/enforced-1.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Top practices "switch" most often when we evolve. 
- High probability that if we "switch" we still get a reasonable cultural configuration (probability, coherence). Can be consonant with different combinations of other features. 
- Generally non-epistemic and cognitive; but reincarnation is weird. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](LICS/enforced-2.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Only epistemic to be high which is weird.
- Seems like it SHOULD be very defining.

- Social: but rare things (e.g. not small-scale ritual)
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](LICS/enforced-5.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Acquisition of some features almost never make a religion more coherent (i.e. acquiring extreme practices). Just too disfavored (main effect). 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](LICS/enforced-6.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Loss of some features alsmost never make a religion more coherent (i.e. losing belief in afterlife). Just too generally favored (perhaps cognitive). 
- Hierarchy: Protestantism in DK and Germany. 
- Maturation of religions; extreme sects, then mainstream (retaining core). Extreme sects do not start in EQUILIBRIUM. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Predicting Missing Data
- Can we predict features of religions that are unknown to the field?

::: {.notes}
- yes we can!
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Predicting Missing Data
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Given the logic inferred from all religions we can predict attributes of a culture that are unknown to the field 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- One example is the Archaic Spartan Cults (800BC-500BC)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
![](cultural-landscapes/spartan-predictions.png){ width=100% }
::: 

::: {.notes}
- Of course child sacrifice rare
- But Spartans do not have any of the other extreme properties, so what we are seeing is more than just that fact. 
- Same with small-scale ritual (couples strongly to large-scale ritual in other observed data)

- discovery of underlying factors. 
- in that case; we can "delete" the other two
- could also be renormalization (decimation or combination). 
- some of this has been done
:::

## New data
- National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
![](mdma.png)
:::

::: {.notes}
- we might have "bad" equilibria and "good" equilibria 
- a coefficient does not really tell the full story about how the system works. 
:::

# Take-home Messages {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- Moving beyond standard regression and obtaining a generative model of a full system of constraints opens up new questions and lenses to understand and explore complex systems.
::: 

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- Outstanding issues around *causality* and *dynamics*. In particular, we do not have "Pearl Style" causality (uni-directional). Out-of-equilibrium we might think of causality as the natural dynamical drift into equilibrium but many possible "dynamics". 
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- The method applies not only to religion (or culture). It has been used on various social and biological systems with interacting components (e.g., neurons). 
:::

::: {.notes}
- Think of the case of cults in the US. 
- Typically start extreme (out of equilibrium)
- Gradually "soften" as they become mainstream.
- Relaxing into equilibrium (which we might interpret as a kind of dynamics or causality).

- Get in touch if you are interested (victormoeller@gmail.com)
- Thanks to the DRH (esp. Edward Slingerland, Rachel Spicer, and Willis Monroe)

# Appendix 

## The Ising Model 

$$p_i = \frac{exp \: E_i(\vec{\theta})}{Z(\vec{\theta})}$$

$$E_i(\vec{\theta}) = \sum_{i,j; i>j} J_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j} + \sum_{i}h_i\sigma_i$$

- $E_i(\vec{\theta})$: energy of a given configuration
- $p_i$: probability of a given configuration
- $Z(\vec{\theta})$: partition function (normalizes); all $p_i$ sum to 1.

::: {.notes}
- pi: probability of a given configuration 
- Ei: energy of system. 
- Z: partition function (normalizes); all p_i sum to 1. 
- sigma_i, sigma_j: binary variables (-1, 1) 
- J_{ij}, h_i: parameters
- typically in physics: assume J, h and investigate properties of distribution. 
- (inverse) problem: infer J, h that best predict distribution.
- high energy: disorder (non-aligned spins) 
- low energy: order (aligned spins) 
- phase transition between these regimes (which I will not discuss).  
:::



## Regularization

![](cultural-landscapes/regularization.png){ width=800px }

::: {.notes}
- prior over parameters (bayesian). 
- Gaussian prior (L2-norm). 
- which we can dynamically infer from data (e.g. using leave-one-out cross-validation). 
- We see significantly less overfitting. 
:::

## Inconsistent data
- approx. 17% of our curated DRH data set

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}$$

::: {.notes}
- Not a problem for the earlier examples...

- mind-body distinction, scriptures, small-scale rituals. 

- two ways of understanding this: 
 - uncertainty question-by-question
 - two different realizations 
- the first appears to be true. 

- Iban traiditional religion: scriptures coded (by the same coder) as both "yes" and "no" (citing it as borderline case). 

:::

## Inconsistent data

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_3 = \{1, 1, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_4 = \{1, 0, 0\}: w = 0.25$$

::: {.notes}
- following the "independent" idea. 
:::


## Partial-MPF (missing data)
$$ j = \{1, 0, X, X\}$$

- Dynamically infer missing data from best estimates of parameters 
- Work with distribution over the (in this case) four possible configurations

::: {.notes}
- not problem for other papers
- this has lead to huge problems in literature
