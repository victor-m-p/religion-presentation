## The Landscape View 
Societies are subject to multiple *intersecting forces and constraints* that *put demands on their features*. Some configurations better balance these constraints.

- landscape is all possible combinations of yes-no answers to questions. 
- has dimension equal to number of questions included. 
- Landscape we do not get directly from parameters of, say, a logistic regression. 
- Equilibrium points: interesting if we have system where we want to either keep in certain equilibrium, or push out of.

## Three Questions
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- $\mathcal{Q}_1$: What are the most probable and the most improbable religious-cultural configurations? How are they organized in the topology of the religion "fitness landscape"?
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- $\mathcal{Q}_2$: What does the landscape imply about dynamics and cultural evolution?
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Can we predict features of religions that are unknown to the field?
:::

::: {.notes}
- That we cannot answer directly with parameters (e.g. from logistic)
- Landscape topology and organization.
- Dynamics and evolution. Fundamental and context.
- Predict unknown (or missing) data. 
::: 

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
- What are the most probable and the most improbable religious-cultural configurations? How are they organized in the topology of the religion "fitness landscape"?

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_4.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- 150 most probable: ignoring parts of landscape (make it possible to approx.)
- small slice 2^20 is 1m (40%)
- size of configurations by probability (e.g. "stability", "coherence", ...)
- Connected if they are direct neighbors (1 hamming).
- clustered based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm (dendrogram). 
- most correspond to observed religions (some more than one) but some are unobserved. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_3.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- what kinds occupy different parts of landscape. 
- I want to be careful but...
- Some structure: 
  - Yellow: pre-Axial / indigenous. 
  - Red: axial / highest-probability.
  - Blue: spiritual and protestant "flood plain".
- Temporal vs. non-temporal 
- Bellah: "Religion in human evolution". 
- fundamentally non-temporal; revisit; universal constraints
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_annot.svg){ width=80%}

::: {.notes}
- archaic sacrificial grave traditions
- ritualistic
- difficult because negative... 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_2.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- A scholar might be interested in a specific tradition. 
- local probability region
- local peak (at our resolution / our Q)
- Would have to move through valley to get to Jehovah. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](DAG/landscape_1.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- Roman Imperial Cult (valley); 
- Should tend to flow "upwards" in the landscape. 
- Not predicted to be very stable by our landscape. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of Religion 
![](cognitive-attractors/monitor-punish.png){ width=100% }

::: {.notes}
- Landscape encodes more "fundamental" and "context specific" constraints
- More cognitively coherent 
- Model of human agency (care enough to punish). 
- Need to monitor to punish? 
  - no: e.g., karmic religions, call God up. 
- Otiose Gods: 
  - watch, but are lazy. 
- some things are just weird.
- fundamentally; Gods built on model of human agency (some cognitive dissonance, but this can exist).

- Metastability. 
- Glauber Dynamics (on average for 20 neighbors, sample a neighbor and stay or move based on relative prob)
- Here all above 50% because these are the observed configurations. 
- this gives a useful vocabulary to consider dynamics.

- all local maxima
- starting from all observed configurations that are not already a local max. 
- hill-climbing (of course dumb).
- Not a straightforward relationship between prob. and delta that you attract from. 
- Iban vs. Ancient Egypt (& neighbor w. Cistercians). 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](LICS/enforced-1.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Top practices "switch" most often when we evolve. 
- High probability that if we "switch" we still get a reasonable cultural configuration (probability, coherence). Can be consonant with different combinations of other features. 
- Generally non-epistemic and cognitive; but reincarnation is weird. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria

:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria

:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics & Equilibria
![](LICS/enforced-6.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Loss of some features alsmost never make a religion more coherent (i.e. losing belief in afterlife). Just too generally favored (perhaps cognitive). 
- Hierarchy: Protestantism in DK and Germany. 
- Maturation of religions; extreme sects, then mainstream (retaining core). Extreme sects do not start in EQUILIBRIUM. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Predicting Missing Data
- Can we predict features of religions that are unknown to the field?

::: {.notes}
- yes we can!
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Predicting Missing Data
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Given the logic inferred from all religions we can predict attributes of a culture that are unknown to the field 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
![](cultural-landscapes/spartan-predictions.png){ width=100% }

::: {.notes}
- Of course child sacrifice rare
- But Spartans do not have any of the other extreme properties, so what we are seeing is more than just that fact. 
- Same with small-scale ritual (couples strongly to large-scale ritual in other observed data)

- a coefficient does not really tell the full story about how the system works. 
:::

# Take-home Messages {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- Moving beyond standard regression and obtaining a generative model of a full system of constraints opens up new questions and lenses to understand and explore complex systems.
::: 

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- Outstanding issues around *causality* and *dynamics*. In particular, we do not have "Pearl Style" causality (uni-directional). Out-of-equilibrium we might think of causality as the natural dynamical drift into equilibrium but many possible "dynamics". 
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- The method applies not only to religion (or culture). It has been used on various social and biological systems with interacting components (e.g., neurons). 
:::

::: {.notes}
- Think of the case of cults in the US. 
- Typically start extreme (out of equilibrium)
- Gradually "soften" as they become mainstream.
- Relaxing into equilibrium (which we might interpret as a kind of dynamics or causality).

# Thank you for your time {.smaller}
- Joint work with Simon DeDeo (CMU, Santa Fe)
- Get in touch if you are interested (victormoeller@gmail.com)
- Thanks to the DRH (esp. Edward Slingerland, Rachel Spicer, and Willis Monroe)
- Thanks to Lee and Daniels (2019) for sparring on Minimum Probability Flow (MPF)
- "Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model", Poulsen & Dedeo (2023) 

# Appendix 

## The Ising Model 

$$p_i = \frac{exp \: E_i(\vec{\theta})}{Z(\vec{\theta})}$$

$$E_i(\vec{\theta}) = \sum_{i,j; i>j} J_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j} + \sum_{i}h_i\sigma_i$$

- $E_i(\vec{\theta})$: energy of a given configuration
- $p_i$: probability of a given configuration
- $Z(\vec{\theta})$: partition function (normalizes); all $p_i$ sum to 1.

::: {.notes}
- pi: probability of a given configuration 
- Ei: energy of system. 
- Z: partition function (normalizes); all p_i sum to 1. 
- sigma_i, sigma_j: binary variables (-1, 1) 
- J_{ij}, h_i: parameters
- typically in physics: assume J, h and investigate properties of distribution. 
- (inverse) problem: infer J, h that best predict distribution.
- high energy: disorder (non-aligned spins) 
- low energy: order (aligned spins) 
- phase transition between these regimes (which I will not discuss).  
:::



## Regularization

![](cultural-landscapes/regularization.png){ width=800px }

::: {.notes}
- prior over parameters (bayesian). 
- Gaussian prior (L2-norm). 
- which we can dynamically infer from data (e.g. using leave-one-out cross-validation). 
- We see significantly less overfitting. 
:::

## Inconsistent data
- approx. 17% of our curated DRH data set

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}$$

::: {.notes}
- Not a problem for the earlier examples...

- mind-body distinction, scriptures, small-scale rituals. 

- two ways of understanding this: 
 - uncertainty question-by-question
 - two different realizations 
- the first appears to be true. 

- Iban traiditional religion: scriptures coded (by the same coder) as both "yes" and "no" (citing it as borderline case). 

:::

## Inconsistent data

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_3 = \{1, 1, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_4 = \{1, 0, 0\}: w = 0.25$$

::: {.notes}
- following the "independent" idea. 
:::


## Partial-MPF (missing data)
$$ j = \{1, 0, X, X\}$$

- Dynamically infer missing data from best estimates of parameters 
- Work with distribution over the (in this case) four possible configurations

::: {.notes}
- not problem for other papers
- this has lead to huge problems in literature
