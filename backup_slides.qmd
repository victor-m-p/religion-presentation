# Agenda 
- The Inverse Ising model in other fields 
- Current approaches to Religion 
- Methodological improvements 
- Results (parameters, landscape, prediction)
- Challenges & What's next?

# Motivation

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Religious culture is "multi-modal" (e.g. `social`, `epistemic`, `cognitive`) and high-dimensional
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Often one (or a few) aspects studied in isolation, or a synthesis is attempted by arguing from isolated results 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Perhaps we cannot understand (religious) culture by considering traits in isolation. (inverse) `Ising model` been applied successfully in various domains. Why not networks of cultural (religious) beliefs?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Not quite "multi-modal" but a lot of different aspects
- High-dimensional meaning that many aspects define a civilization
- Isolation
  - e.g., ...
- Landscape: we will get back to what we mean by a `landscape model`

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- `Cultural Evolution` (`Anthropology`):
  - Focus: biodiversity
  - Example: `Big Gods` 
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- By-product: 
 - religion is a by-product of (universal) cognitive processes
 - intuitive dualism, anthropomorphism, theory of mind, ...

- Adaptationist: 
 - Is this just genetic rather than cultural selection?

- Cultural Evolution: 
  - Big Gods enable large-scale society (i.e., monitoring and punishment leads to prosocial behavior which is necessary for anonymous large-scale society, and which gives a selective advantage for groups who have these beliefs in inter-group conflict with groups that do not have these beliefs). NB: the `Big Gods` book draws upon both cultural evolutionary, and cognitive/psychological approaches. 

- We are not biased towards any of these approaches, and include questions that are epistemic/cognitive (e.g. mind-body dualism), social (e.g. rituals), political (e.g. state support).

::: {.notes}
- $N = 9$ justices on the Rehnquist court. 
- On the right: 
  - Local fields ($h_i$) on top. Bias of a justice towards yes/no.
  - Coupling ($J_{ij}$) on bottom. Coupling between justices. 
- On the left: 
  - Independent model (blue) versus Ising model (red) and data (green).
  - The Ising model captures the data better (almost perfect).

"Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a neural population", Schneidman et al. (2006)
:::

## The (unreasonable) effectiveness of the Ising model
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- In general, surface-level correlations and means can be misleading, and they do not imply the strongly coupled network states (e.g. specific configurations) that we observe.  
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- The Ising model can capture the underlying structure (in general, higher-order correlations come "along for the ride").
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- This works (unreasonably) well in various domains (e.g. `biological`, and `social` networks). 
:::

## The (inverse) Ising model {.smaller}
- $J_{ij}$: the strength of the interaction between nodes $i$ and $j$. $J > 0$ positive coupling, $J < 0$ negative coupling. `Not the same as the surface-level correlation`.
- $h_i$: The strength of the local (magnetic) field. Intrinsic bias in favor of being on rather than off (1/0, yes/no). `Not the same as the overall mean`.
- Probability of a particular configuration is: 
$$ P(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_N) = \frac{1}{Z} exp \left[ \sum_{i} h_i \sigma_i + \sum_{i > j} J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j \right] $$
- Symmetric, so $J_{ij} = J_{ji}$ (thus $i>j$). 

## Challenges & Solutions
- Previous work has used small $N$ where direct calculation is possible. $N$ parameters grows exponentially with $N$. 
- Previous work has used complete and consistent data without obvious bias sources. 
- Use of the Minimum Probability Flow (MPF) algorithm to infer the model parameters.
- Regularization and cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
- Re-weighting to correct for sampling bias. 
- Consistent integration of partially observed data. 

::: {.notes}
- Courts (N=9) and Neurons (N=10). 
- Courts and Neurons both "complete" (e.g. no missig records, NAN, or contested cases). 
- Our case (N=20) and unknown data (e.g. Spartan child sacrifice) and bias (e.g. historical). 
- MPF: General idea is that probability flows from observed states to neighboring states. 
- Regularization: $L_2$-norm (Gaussian prior).

# Ways of approaching the landscape {.smaller}
- We can look directly at pairwise couplings $J_{ij}$ and local fields $h_i$ 
- We can use the model to predict unknown data 
- We can look at the landscape that the pairwise couplings imply (globally, and locally) 
- We can approach specific theories of religion and see how they fit into the landscape
- (Maybe) the landscape can generate new ideas, or constrain theorizing

- In some cases they are not:

## Predicting unknown data {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Some facts about the cultural record are unknown to the field
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- One example is the Archaic Spartan Cults (800BC-500BC)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Coded in the DRH as unknown for: 
  - Practice of `child sacrifice` 
  - Requirement to participate in `small-scale rituals`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Given the inferred landscape, and what we *do* know about the Spartans, we can provide a quantitative estimate

## The Landscape of Religion

::: {.notes}
- 150 highest-probability configurations
- most correspond to observed religions (some more than one) but not all.
- Some structure: 
  - Yellow: tends early, pre-Axial, and indigenous. 
  - Red: tends medium, Axial, highest-probability cluster. 
  - Blue: tends late, development of monotheism, "flood plain".
