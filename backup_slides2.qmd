# Norenzayan (2013)
![](DAG/norenzayan1.svg){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
Influential book (Also subsequent articles) - our starting point (although idea older)
- claim: statistical causal relationship: 
 - Big Gods -> prosociality / cooperation -> intergroup conflict advantage & social complexity (e.g. anonymous societies). 
Arguing from: 
- psychological studies 
- cross-cultural observation 
:::

# Norenzayan (2013)
![](DAG/norenzayan2.svg){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
- "Being watched" the driver (psychological studies)
- Secular Institutions OR MSP can play this role
 - faith-related primes, and e.g. 'court', 'police' have similar effect. 
 - but DYNAMICS because societies have (generally) gone through the MSP route first
:::

# Norenzayan (2013) 
![](DAG/norenzayan3.svg){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
- Belief in the first place by-product of ordinary cognition: 
  - e.g. teleological thinking, mentalizing, theory of mind, ...
  - God modeled on fundamental cognitive understanding of (human) agency. 
- We now have: Cognitive, Epistemic, Social questions. 
:::

# Whitehouse (2019)
![](DAG/whitehouse1.svg){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
- data-driven approach (Seshat: Global History Databank) - time-series analysis
- consistent in associating Big Gods and Big Societies (but causality other direction)
- Dotted arrows because they acknowledge that Big Gods might sustain (e.g. through prosocial cooperation). 
- Not quite "by-product" (might enforce) but not necessary.
:::

# Whitehouse (2019)
![](DAG/whitehouse2.svg){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
- Standardization of rituals preceede big Gods. 

# Turchin (2022)
![](DAG/turchin1.svg){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
- data-driven approach (Seshat: Global History Databank) -- 100-year intervals, allowing lagged (causal) models. 
 - warfare, animal husbandry, agricultural productivity previously linked to Big Gods.
- big Gods (moralizing supernatural punishment) does not drive social complexity 
- common cause (shared evolutionary driver) of both big Gods and big societies. 
- psychological / behavioural data supporting the link between big Gods & social complexity questioned.

- Strong correlation between 'big Gods' and 'big societies' - but causality difficult to establish.
- Challenges in missing data, expert disagreement, and unobserved variables.
- Lack of agreement on causal cultural evolutionary drivers (both "how" and "which").

- Not to say that we do not care about dynamics and causation (and we will discuss this)
We can imagine expanding this web: 
- additional cognitive, environmental, political factors, ...
- at least creating that "playground" seems worthwhile to help/constrain/guide theory building. 
:::

# Our starting point 
- We want to infer a generative model of larger systems of constraints 
that we can probe at different levels

- level of inferred constraints (parameters)
- level of the "landscape" (i.e. probability distribution over configurations). 
- Allowing us to simulate dynamics, conduct synthetic RCTs, etc. 
:::

## The (inverse) Ising model
- given (1) binary data, and (2) constraints on `means` and `pairwise correlations` the (inverse) Ising model is the maximum entropy model.

::: {.notes}
- binary data which is what these databases (seshat, DRH) mainly catalog (although some have aggregated these into numeric values). 
- least structured model consistent with observed means and pairwise correlations. 
- no explicitly modeling higher-order correlations (e.g. triplets). 
- we will see that this is likely not a problem. 
:::

## The (inverse) Ising model
![](DAG/ising-2.svg){ width=1500px }

::: {.notes}
- Spin-up, spin-down (in our case, yes/no answers to questions)
- This would correspond to one observation (configuration). 
:::

## The (inverse) Ising model
![](DAG/ising-1.svg){ width=1500px }

::: {.notes}
- spin-up = 1, spin-down = -1
:::

## The (inverse) Ising model

$$p_i = \frac{exp \: E_i(\vec{\theta})}{Z(\vec{\theta})}$$

$$E_i(\vec{\theta}) = \sum_{i,j; i>j} J_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j} + \sum_{i}h_i\sigma_i$$

- $E_i(\vec{\theta})$: energy of a given configuration
- $p_i$: probability of a given configuration
- $Z(\vec{\theta})$: partition function (normalizes); all $p_i$ sum to 1.

::: {.notes}
- pi: probability of a given configuration 
- Ei: energy of system. 
- Z: partition function (normalizes); all p_i sum to 1. 
- sigma_i, sigma_j: binary variables (-1, 1) 
- J_{ij}, h_i: parameters
- typically in physics: assume J, h and investigate properties of distribution. 
- (inverse) problem: infer J, h that best predict distribution.
- high energy: disorder (non-aligned spins) 
- low energy: order (aligned spins) 
- phase transition between these regimes (which I will not discuss).  
:::

## The (inverse) Ising model
![](top_configs.svg){ width=60% }

::: {.notes}
- now we just think of these spin-up, spin-down as yes/no answers to questions & go from 2-dimensional lattice to a 20-dimensional space (hyper-cube)
- here, the most probable configuration in the landscape we infer
- deliberately not labeled these with actual religions (to avoid derailing the show).
- So, we have at least statistical / information-theoretic reasons for thinking that the ising model makes sense. 
- Notice that one of these is a bit different; I invite you to take a guess at a religion which occupies one of the most stable positions in the landscape, but which is not surrounded by the other most stable religions in the landscape.

- $N = 9$ justices on the Rehnquist court (yes/no)
- On the right: 
  - Local fields ($h_i$) on top. Bias of a justice towards voting liberal vs. conservative.
  - Coupling ($J_{ij}$) on bottom. Coupling between justices. 
- On the left: 
  - Many cases of consensus (i.e. 0, 9) where the case is just "good" or "bad" and many fewer cases along ideological lines (than the independent model would predict).

"Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a neural population", Schneidman et al. (2006)
:::

::: {.notes}
- $N=10$ exact and $N = 40$ neurons monte carlo (spike/no spike). 
- again, "independent" model breaks down because interactions are important (higher-order captured by pairwise).
- Some configurations (macro states) are many orders of magnitude more likely given the inverse Ising solution than the "independent" model. 
- 
:::

# Technical challenges
- Previous examples have "complete" data (Ising model only works for "complete" data)
- Previous data is not obviously biased (or subject to interpretation or disagreement)
- Since this is not true for our source of data we need to solve some problems

# Technical innovations {.smaller}

![](references/mpf.png){ width=60% fig-align='center' }

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- Sohl-Dickstein, J., Battaglino, P., & DeWeese, M. R. (2009). "Minimum probability flow learning".
:::

::: {.notes}
- improvements to Minimum Probability Flow (MPF)
- exponentially hard to solve for J, h (thus MPF which I will not go into the details of). Paper on neurons used Monte Carlo simulation. There are various ways you can try to approximate the solution. 
:::

## 1. Regularization

![](cultural-landscapes/regularization.png){ width=800px }

::: {.notes}
- prior over parameters (bayesian). 
- Gaussian prior (L2-norm). 
- which we can dynamically infer from data (e.g. using leave-one-out cross-validation). 
- We see significantly less overfitting. 
:::

## 2. Inconsistent data
- approx. 17% of our curated DRH data set

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}$$

::: {.notes}
- mind-body distinction, scriptures, small-scale rituals. 

- two ways of understanding this: 
 - uncertainty question-by-question
 - two different realizations 
- the first appears to be true. 

- Iban traiditional religion: scriptures coded (by the same coder) as both "yes" and "no" (citing it as borderline case). 

:::

## 2. Inconsistent data

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_3 = \{1, 1, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_4 = \{1, 0, 0\}: w = 0.25$$

::: {.notes}
- following the "independent" idea. 
:::


## 3. Partial-MPF (missing data)
$$ j = \{1, 0, X, X\}$$

- Dynamically infer missing data from best estimates of parameters 
- Work with distribution over the (in this case) four possible configurations

::: {.notes}
This is perhaps the most interesting technical innovation.
- Recall the big Gods debate: 
 - Whitehouse (2019) retracted because it coded "missing" as "no". 
 - Results change when (1) no records with missing data are included and (2) standard imputation.
  - Lots of missing data (why omitting is bad) 
  - Epistemic fallacy to impute e.g. "median" beliefs of contemporary civilizations on ancient ones.
- importantly; we cannot follow the previous approach of equal weighting.  
:::

## 3. Partial-MPF (missing data)
![](cultural-landscapes/partial-mpf.png){ width=70% }

## 3. Partial-MPF (missing data)

- One example is the Archaic Spartan Cults (800BC-500BC) 

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Given the inferred landscape (e.g. what we know about constraints from other observed religions), and what we *do* know about the Spartans, we can provide a quantitative estimate
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
![](cultural-landscapes/spartan-predictions.png){ width=100% }
::: 

::: {.notes}
- sneak peak on results (prediction of unknown data)

- Some facts about the cultural record are unknown to the field

- One example is the Archaic Spartan Cults (800BC-500BC)

- Coded in the DRH as unknown for: 
  - Practice of `child sacrifice` 
  - Requirement to participate in `small-scale rituals`

- Given the inferred landscape, and what we *do* know about the Spartans, we can provide a quantitative estimate

# What we have 
- A set of pairwise couplings $J_{ij}$ between features, and local fields $h_i$ for each feature. 
- These correspond to (transformations) of the parameters one could infer from a series of logistic regressions. 
- Different from surface-level correlations and means.

## Dynamics over $J_{ij}$?
![](DAG/params_path_1.svg){ width=100% }

::: {.notes}
- note: it is STATIC but we can start forming hypotheses 
- Belief in afterlife + spirit body-distinction cognitive underpinnings;
- make big Gods (modeled on understanding of human agency) more coherent.
:::

## Dynamics over $J_{ij}$?
![](DAG/params_path_2.svg){ width=100% }

- drift through corpse treatment and grave-goods to co-sacrifices. 
:::

## Dynamics over $J_{ij}$?

- and now we end up with extreme practices.
:::

## Dynamics over $J_{ij}$?
![](DAG/params_path_4.svg){ width=100%}

::: {.notes}
- Notice the direct connection is negative
- But the same set of beliefs might lead through a cultural-evolutionary path. 
- But, careful Icarus! (the parameters are not directional)
- We can start thinking about / hypothesizing dynamics over the landscape. 
- "synthetic" RCTs on, e.g. by forcing a change in a variable and monitoring another given some dynamic 
:::

# Plan
- The 'big Gods' debate
- Data, model & methodological improvements 
- Fundamental constraints (parameters)
- `The "landscape" of possible religions (configurations)`
- Dynamics over the landscape 
- Closing remarks 

::: {.notes}
- Leave parameters for now, and look at the landscape that they imply. 
- This is normally where you'd stop (i.e. we have looked at our coefficients)
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_4.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- 150 highest-probability configurations (very small slice because 2^20 is 1m, but more than 40% of the total probability mass)
- size of configurations by probability (e.g. "stability", "coherence", ...)
- Connected if they are direct neighbors (1 hamming).
- clustered based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm (dendrogram). 
- most correspond to observed religions (some more than one) but some are unobserved. 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_3.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- Some structure: 
  - Yellow: tends early, pre-Axial, and indigenous. 
  - Red: tends medium, Axial, highest-probability cluster. 
  - Blue: tends late, development of monotheism, "flood plain".
- isolated peaks: e.g. Jehovah, and a group of high-probability (red). 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_2.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- Free Methodist Church
 - local peak (Jehovah 2 steps away). 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_1.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- Roman Imperial Cult
 - valley with several higher-probability neighbors
:::

# Plan
- The 'big Gods' debate
- Data, model & methodological improvements 
- Fundamental constraints (parameters)
- The "landscape" of possible religions (configurations)
- `Dynamics over the landscape` 
- Closing remarks 

::: {.notes}
- some ways we can start thinking about dynamics over the landscape which fundamentally encodes the static (universal) constraints 
:::

## Cultural Stability {.smaller}
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/local_global_stability.svg){ width=70% }

::: {.notes}
- Local stability vs. global stability. 
- For shorter time-scales we need more than "hills" and "valleys": 
 - islated peak: Jehovah
 - mountain range: Donatism
 - hillock: meta-stable (not super probable, but neighbors even less probable). 
 - valley: not probable, more probable neighbors 
- Here p_remain is a particular dynamics that we have imposed (something called glauber dynamics). p(i->j) = 1/N p(j)/p(i)+p(j). 
- This ties in to the more general idea that we are trying to explore with temporal effects; i.e. given long enough time-scales starting position does not matter, but for shorter time-scales it does (we saw sort-of the same idea for the parameters we looked at earlier where if you do not have a functioning society, one way to get there might be to acquire a belief in high Gods, but if you already have a functioning society with secular institutions it might not make sense to acquire that belief). 
:::

## Cultural Attractors {.smaller}
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/Irish_Catholics_1017606.svg){ width=55%}

::: {.notes}
- Deterministic flow (Y-axis is probability). 
- Traits are favored contingent on local region of the landscape: 
  - IR - YD - C: ... 
  - IR - NAN - QM - (OD, YD) - C: ... 
- As ecologists well know dynamics are context dependent. 
:::

## Fluidity of cultural belief systems 
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/number_enforced_first_five.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
Which practices most easily fit in with various systems?
:::

# Plan
- The 'big Gods' debate
- Data, model & methodological improvements 
- Fundamental constraints (parameters)
- The "landscape" of possible religions (configurations)
- Dynamics over the landscape
- `Closing remarks`

# 'big Gods' (sort of) revisited

## Model of human agency
![](cognitive-attractors/monitor-punish.png){ width=100% }

::: {.notes}
- More cognitively plausible to have either both or neither (understood from model of human agency): 
 - if someone cares enough to punish, they care enough to monitor.
 - we might even think that you would need to monitor to punish, but this is overly abrahamic-centric (i.e. karma). 
:::

## Secular institutions
![](cognitive-attractors/monitor-punish-conditional.png){ width=100%}

::: {.notes}
- Secular institutions generally make not punishing and monitoring more likely. 
- Especially the monitoring appears to be "outsourceable" to the state. 
:::

::: {.notes}
- Just wanted to tie this back to Norenzayan
- Big Gods overall less likely in our landscape GIVEN state support (which we might take as a very rough proxy for secular institutions). 
:::

## Fundamental & context-dependent constraints

![](cognitive-attractors/monitor-punish-conditional.png){ width=100%}

:::

# Next steps
- How does landscape topology change with more questions?

![](rank_vs_normp.svg){ width=60% fig-align='center' }

::: {.notes}
- We have some preliminary results suggesting that although the parameters shrink (because we control for increasingly more variables) the landscape becomes increasingly rugged. 
:::

# Next steps 
- Discovery of underlying structure?

![](DAG/params_reference.svg){ width=70% }

::: {.notes}
- We have not successfully achieved this yet.
- We are running simulations to evaluate the potential of this approach. 
:::

# Next steps 
- Integrating temporal information to understand dynamics
- e.g., protestantism in Germany at time $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ 


::: {.notes}
- E.g. working with DRH people to curate "paths" over the landscape. 
- Understand e.g., that an intermediary step might be "necessary" for a particular cultural evolution. 
- Works towards something that starts to smell like causal understanding. 
:::


# Take-home Messages
- Parameters (coefficients) generally meaningful/reasonable & might guide/constrain hypothesizing
- Landscape topology shows meaningful structure which can be read partially temporally (e.g. early/late)
- Critical to consider timescales (e.g. local/global stability) and contextual favoring of traits
- Some features might be more/less defining of a particular religion than others
