"Statistical Mechanics of the US Supreme Court", Lee et al. (2015)
:::

::: {.notes}
- different domains: (social, biological systems)
- elements binary, interactions between micro-level features important for macro-level behavior
- Eddie Lee (coniii) - who has been really helpful
- mostly positive (sympathetic) couplings 
- sympathetic couplings -> unanimous decisions
- makes it pretty clear WHICH judge you have to "swing"

# Data & model overview {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- 20 binary questions (e.g. epistemic, social, etc.) is the basic level of analysis & they define a religion as a 20-dimensional cultural object in our analysis
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- 407 total religions in our curated data set (with at most 5 unknown attributes for the 20 questions)
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- Terminology alert: We refer to questions as "features" or "properties". Refer to particular set of answers to all 20 questions as a "configuration". 
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- around 1 million possible configurations for 20 questions ($2^{20}$)
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- 210 parameters (local fields, pairwise couplings)
:::

::: {.notes}
- local fields: intrinsically biased towards yes / no
- pairwise couplings: strongly coupled sympathetically / antipathetically; how strongly do they constrain each other; how much does learning one tell us about the other. 
:::

# Why build this model? {.smaller}
::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- $\mathcal{Q}_1$: What are the most probable, and the most improbable religious-cultural configurations? In particular, what does the topology of the religion "fitness landscape" look like? 
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- $\mathcal{Q}_2$: What does the landscape model imply about dynamics and cultural evolution? 
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Can we reasonably capture fundamental and context-specific constraints on religious cultures? 
:::

::: {.notes}
- Which are favored, which are disfavored?
- jagged, smooth hill (e.g. local maxima, one big mountain). 
- Fundamentally static model (fundamental constraints). 
- e.g., both as predicted by common-sense & other work in religious studies. 
:::

# 
![](pictures/entropy_mdpi.png)

::: {.notes}
- we try to answer some of those questions here
- the focus on dynamics / cultural evolution in preprint. 
:::

## $\mathcal{Q}_1$: "Landscape" of religion 
- What are the most probable, and the most improbable religious-cultural configurations? 

- In particular, what does the topology of the religion "fitness landscape" look like?

#  
![](heatmap_observed.svg)

::: {.notes}
- counting (e.g. 8, 6, ...)
- top row appears most times, ...
- we only observe ~300 unique, complete configurations. 
- cannot say anothing beyond these (and even this is not very informative). 
:::

# 
![](heatmap_naive.svg)

::: {.notes}
- independent (naive) 
- for each trait; probability of yes/no (i.e. mean). 
- simply baseline. 
- same as examples (earlier) 
:::

# 
![](heatmap_model.svg)

::: {.notes}
- pretty "consistent" for the top configurations. 
- most probable part of landscape will be most similar.
- this just makes more sense (and the landscape implied by this model is very different from that implied by the independent baseline). 
- problem is that landscape lives in 20 dimensions. 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_4.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- 150 most probable: ignoring parts of landscape (make it possible to approx.)
- small slice 2^20 is 1m (40%)
- size of configurations by probability (e.g. "stability", "coherence", ...)
- Connected if they are direct neighbors (1 hamming).
- clustered based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm (dendrogram). 
- most correspond to observed religions (some more than one) but some are unobserved. 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_3.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- what kinds occupy different parts of landscape. 
- I want to be careful but...
- Some structure: 
  - Yellow: pre-Axial / indigenous. 
  - Red: axial / highest-probability.
  - Blue: spiritual and protestant "flood plain".
- Temporal vs. non-temporal 
- Bellah: "Religion in human evolution". 
- fundamentally non-temporal; revisit; universal constraints
:::


## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_annot.svg){ width=80%}

::: {.notes}
- archaic sacrificial grave traditions
- ritualistic
- difficult because negative... 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_2.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- A scholar might be interested in a specific tradition. 
- local probability region
- local peak (at our resolution / our Q)
- Would have to move through valley to get to Jehovah. 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](DAG/landscape_1.svg){ width=80% }

::: {.notes}
- Roman Imperial Cult (valley); 
- Should tend to flow "upwards" in the landscape. 
- Not predicted to be very stable by our landscape. 
:::

## The "landscape" of religion
![](pictures/pagan-return.png){ width=70% }

::: {.notes}
- Fell over yesterday. 
- Not clear that there is one-directional dynamic
- Previous "solutions" might be revisited (e.g. spiritual, pagan) from SECULAR. 
- Away from monotheistic, Abrahamic high-Gods.
- "Temple of the Jedi" (go back to slide). 
- Temporal; Spatial agnostic. 
::: 

# $\mathcal{Q}_2$: Dynamics 
- Can we approach "dynamics" over the landscape of religious cultures?

::: {.notes}
- some ways we can start thinking about dynamics over the landscape which fundamentally encodes the static (universal) constraints 
:::

## Cultural Stability {.smaller}
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/local_global_stability.svg){ width=70% }

::: {.notes}
- Stability on different timescales. 
- Long enough timescales; baseline probability. 
- Shorter timescales; local probability region (neighbors). 
- Metastability. 
- Glauber Dynamics (on average for 20 neighbors, sample a neighbor and stay or move based on relative prob)
- Here all above 50% because these are the observed configurations. 
- isolated peak, mountain range, hillock, valley. 
- this gives a useful vocabulary to consider dynamics. 
:::

## Cultural Attractors {.smaller}
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/Irish_Catholics_1017606.svg){ width=55%}

::: {.notes}
- Impose only flow upwards, terminate at local max. 
- Multiple local maxima (terminate at one of three; pretty different). 
- Explain colors
- Explain size 
- "supernatural punishment", (2) "special corpse treatment"
- two indirect paths; "official political support" lost + regained (not Northern). 
- attributes not adaptive in general; contextually. 
:::

## Cultural Attractors {.smaller}
![](cognitive-attractors/attractors-table.png)

::: {.notes}
- all local maxima
- starting from all observed configurations that are not already a local max. 
- hill-climbing (of course dumb).
- Not a straightforward relationship between prob. and delta that you attract from. 
- Iban vs. Ancient Egypt (& neighbor w. Cistercians). 
:::

## Teaching & Enforcement

![](pictures/tacit.png)

::: {.notes}
- inspired by Helena Miton
- teaching/transmit cultural knowledge
:::

## Teaching & Enforcement 
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/enforcement_hdi.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Enforce the most "fragile" properties
- Might be unstable because of a few cultural competitors in local region of religious landscape. 
- Might only be few local competitors
- Funneling; often few competitors. 
:::

## Fluidity of cultural belief systems 
![](cognitive-attractors/svg/number_enforced_first_five.svg){ width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Some practices just really strongly favored or disfavored. 
- We are starting from observed ...
- The cultural competitors are practices that are (1) not generally strongly preferred or dispreferred & can be consonant with various other sets of practices. 
- Generally non-epistemic and cognitive; but reincarnation.
- Christianity; DK vs. Germany; 
- (1) some things cannot easily be taught; (2) some things might not be taken as "necessary" by the religious community. 
- maturation of religions; new sects extreme, then more mainstream (e.g. retaining only a core) - lifecycle. 
:::

# $\mathcal{Q}_3$: Constraints 
- Fundamental & Context-Specific constraints on religious cultures

## Monitoring & punishing Gods
![](cognitive-attractors/monitor-punish.png){ width=100% }

::: {.notes}
- More cognitively coherent 
- Model of human agency (care enough to punish). 
- Need to monitor to punish? 
  - no: e.g., karmic religions, call God up. 
- Otiose Gods: 
  - watch, but are lazy. 
- some things are just weird.
- fundamentally; Gods built on model of human agency (some cognitive dissonance, but this can exist).

- This is our preferred way of investigating dynamics currently
- Taking all relevant pathways into account
- Does not directly give us mechanism, causality, ...
- Not directly parameters; but what they do. 
- symmetry in parameter-space, assymetry in configuration space.
:::

## Prediction
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Given the logic inferred from all religions we can predict attributes of a culture that are unknown to the field 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- One example is the Archaic Spartan Cults (800BC-500BC)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
![](cultural-landscapes/spartan-predictions.png){ width=100% }
::: 

::: {.notes}
- Of course child sacrifice rare
- But Spartans do not have any of the other extreme properties, so what we are seeing is more than just that fact.

# Thank you for your time {.smaller}
- Joint work with Simon DeDeo (CMU, Santa Fe)
- Thanks to the DRH (esp. Edward Slingerland, Rachel Spicer, and Willis Monroe)
- Thanks to Lee and Daniels (2019) for sparring on Minimum Probability Flow (MPF)

# Appendix 

## The Ising Model 

$$p_i = \frac{exp \: E_i(\vec{\theta})}{Z(\vec{\theta})}$$

$$E_i(\vec{\theta}) = \sum_{i,j; i>j} J_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j} + \sum_{i}h_i\sigma_i$$

- $E_i(\vec{\theta})$: energy of a given configuration
- $p_i$: probability of a given configuration
- $Z(\vec{\theta})$: partition function (normalizes); all $p_i$ sum to 1.

::: {.notes}
- pi: probability of a given configuration 
- Ei: energy of system. 
- Z: partition function (normalizes); all p_i sum to 1. 
- sigma_i, sigma_j: binary variables (-1, 1) 
- J_{ij}, h_i: parameters
- typically in physics: assume J, h and investigate properties of distribution. 
- (inverse) problem: infer J, h that best predict distribution.
- high energy: disorder (non-aligned spins) 
- low energy: order (aligned spins) 
- phase transition between these regimes (which I will not discuss).  
:::



## Regularization

![](cultural-landscapes/regularization.png){ width=800px }

::: {.notes}
- prior over parameters (bayesian). 
- Gaussian prior (L2-norm). 
- which we can dynamically infer from data (e.g. using leave-one-out cross-validation). 
- We see significantly less overfitting. 
:::

## Inconsistent data
- approx. 17% of our curated DRH data set

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}$$

::: {.notes}
- Not a problem for the earlier examples...

- mind-body distinction, scriptures, small-scale rituals. 

- two ways of understanding this: 
 - uncertainty question-by-question
 - two different realizations 
- the first appears to be true. 

- Iban traiditional religion: scriptures coded (by the same coder) as both "yes" and "no" (citing it as borderline case). 

:::

## Inconsistent data

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_3 = \{1, 1, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_4 = \{1, 0, 0\}: w = 0.25$$

::: {.notes}
- following the "independent" idea. 
:::


## Partial-MPF (missing data)
$$ j = \{1, 0, X, X\}$$

- Dynamically infer missing data from best estimates of parameters 
- Work with distribution over the (in this case) four possible configurations

::: {.notes}
- not problem for other papers
- this has lead to huge problems in literature
