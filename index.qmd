# Data & model overview {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- 20 binary questions (e.g. epistemic, social, etc.) is the basic level of analysis & they define a religion as a 20-dimensional cultural object in our analysis
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- 407 total religions in our curated data set (with at most 5 unknown attributes for the 20 questions)
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- We call a particular set of answers to all 20 questions a "configuration"
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- around 1 million possible configurations for 20 questions ($2^{20}$)
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-out}
- 210 parameters (local fields, pairwise couplings)
:::

::: {.notes}
- the 20 questions with the best coverage
- 407 (NAN & inconsistency)
- 190 Pairwise couplings (sympathetic, antisympathetic)
- 20 Local fields (intrinsic bias towards yes/no). 
- These are the parameters we infer from the data. 
:::

- Glauber Dynamics (y-axis) 
- Types: 
  - isolated peak

- Given that we run some dynamics long enough we just get stationary; we are interested in shorter / intermediary time-scales; dynamics. 
- Would be interesting to validate.

- Light blue nodes are "configurations" that are not observed. 
- Size of nodes by how many bit-flips from Irish Catholic configuration. 

- medieval Cistercian order + other monastics (most probable); 
- Jehovah + number of evangelic (also very probable); 
- Sokoto caliphate; 

- (1) "supernatural punishment", (2) "special corpse treatment"
- two indirect paths; "official political support"

# Take-home Messages {.smaller}

# Appendix 

## The Ising Model 

$$p_i = \frac{exp \: E_i(\vec{\theta})}{Z(\vec{\theta})}$$

$$E_i(\vec{\theta}) = \sum_{i,j; i>j} J_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j} + \sum_{i}h_i\sigma_i$$

- $E_i(\vec{\theta})$: energy of a given configuration
- $p_i$: probability of a given configuration
- $Z(\vec{\theta})$: partition function (normalizes); all $p_i$ sum to 1.

::: {.notes}
- pi: probability of a given configuration 
- Ei: energy of system. 
- Z: partition function (normalizes); all p_i sum to 1. 
- sigma_i, sigma_j: binary variables (-1, 1) 
- J_{ij}, h_i: parameters
- typically in physics: assume J, h and investigate properties of distribution. 
- (inverse) problem: infer J, h that best predict distribution.
- high energy: disorder (non-aligned spins) 
- low energy: order (aligned spins) 
- phase transition between these regimes (which I will not discuss).

## Regularization

![](cultural-landscapes/regularization.png){ width=800px }

::: {.notes}
- prior over parameters (bayesian). 
- Gaussian prior (L2-norm). 
- which we can dynamically infer from data (e.g. using leave-one-out cross-validation). 
- We see significantly less overfitting. 
:::

## Inconsistent data
- approx. 17% of our curated DRH data set

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}$$

::: {.notes}
- Not a problem for the earlier examples...

- mind-body distinction, scriptures, small-scale rituals. 

- two ways of understanding this: 
 - uncertainty question-by-question
 - two different realizations 
- the first appears to be true. 

- Iban traiditional religion: scriptures coded (by the same coder) as both "yes" and "no" (citing it as borderline case). 

:::

## Inconsistent data

$$r_1 = \{1, 1, 0\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_2 = \{1, 0, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_3 = \{1, 1, 1\}: w = 0.25$$
$$r_4 = \{1, 0, 0\}: w = 0.25$$

::: {.notes}
- following the "independent" idea. 
:::


## Partial-MPF (missing data)
$$ j = \{1, 0, X, X\}$$

- Dynamically infer missing data from best estimates of parameters 
- Work with distribution over the (in this case) four possible configurations

::: {.notes}
- not problem for other papers
- this has lead to huge problems in literature
